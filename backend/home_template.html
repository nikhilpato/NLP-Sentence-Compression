        <h1>Project 2: Sentence Compression</h1>
        <p>Authors: Nikhil Patolia, Roberto Dominguez<br><br><br></p>

        <h4>Project Description:</h4>
        <p>
            This project is focused on being able to take a sentence and compressing it to the main subject of the whole <br>
            sentence. The resultant output sentence must be grammatically correct while still maintaining the information <br>
            from the original sentence. The impact of this project is that it could easily compress large documents to be <br>
            able to either search them quickly or to make a document have less text to read in general.<br><br><br>
        </p>

        <h4> How to Use:</h4>
        <p>
            Enter a sentence of any length in the textbox below and click submit.  We will then take your sentence and <br>
            reduce the length of it, showing only the main subject of the sentence.  The output sentence is expected to be <br>
            grammatically correct.<br><br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Enter your sentence here:</h3>

        <form method="POST">
            <textarea name="textbox"></textarea>
            <button type="submit" name="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>

        <h3>Output:</h3>


        <p>{{short_sent}}</p>
